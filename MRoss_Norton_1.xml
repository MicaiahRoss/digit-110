        I received particular joy at seeing, within the smell of the land, an Old Yorkshire man of foreseer who had left his son a merchant in <placeName ref="new-york">New York</placeName>, to breath his last in his native land; far from the continued storms we met &amp; feeble situation he was in from sea sickness I had been apprehensive we should have lost him on the passage.

        Coasting the Southwest shore of <placeName ref="ireland">Ireland</placeName> on that <date>18th</date> in the evening we made <placeName ref="cork">Cork</placeName>, where we were becalmed 
        <choice><sic>where</sic><corr>were</corr></choice>
        – we met there a ship we had seen two days before at a distance, she was an armed vessel of <placeName ref="liverpool">Liverpool</placeName>, that had been at <placeName ref="barbados">Barbados</placeName>, and was now returning, she had on board the Governor, and suite of a Dutch settlement in the <placeName ref="west-indies">West Indies</placeName>, lately taken by the <orgName type="military">British troops</orgName> – There is not much appearance of verdure yet on shore – or it might in some respect afford a beautiful prospect – but they have a disagreeable way of decorating their coasts with 
        <choice><sic>jibbets</sic><corr>gibbets</corr></choice>
        here and there – Is it not surprising, that a people so enlightened, so humane and so polite should have it so arranged, that the first object striking the view of the strangers, who approach their <del type="lexical">land</del><add>shore</add> 
        should be an emblem of the severity of their laws and depravity of some of their people. <rs type="technology">Telegraphs</rs> were also to be seen on every eminence – this is a late invention to communicate intelligence of the approach of an enemy or to give orders to the ships of the <orgName type="military">Navy</orgName> – they are on a line of communica<lb/>tion within distinct view of each other – certain figures are put up which are repeated from one

        to the other without being understood by any but those from whom the orders issue and the commanders of Posts. We there learnt, by the boats which came from the shore, that all was as yet tranquil, that they had only heard of the threats of Bonaparte which it was not likely, he would be able to put in execu<lb/>tion.

        After night a fair wind springing up, we made sail, and next morning, we were abreast of <placeName ref="wicklow">Wicklow Mountains</placeName>, the land is high and elevated, but we were at too great a distance to distinctly view it – On the <date>21st</date> we sailed along the <placeName ref="wales">Welsh Coast</placeName> and passed <placeName ref="holyhead">Holyhead</placeName> – here is elevated land &amp; lofty mountains, whose tops are covered with snow, which although they do not prepossess you with an idea of the fertility of the country, yet the natural Majestic grandeur of the asylum of the descendants of ancient Britons strikes the mind with veneration at the magnanimity and unfortunate valor of their ancestors who preferred breathing the air of freedom on Rocky Mountains, to remaining in subjection on their native fertile plains, and calls a sigh for their hero the gallant <persName>Caractacus</persName>.

        In the evening a Pilot comes on board and next day we arrive safe in dock here, the pleasure we felt on the occasion can not well be imagined by any but those, who have made a long sea voyage. Altho’ this was Sunday and business lulled at rest, yet sufficient was to be seen to give a stranger some conception of the magnitude of the trade carried on at this place – the many store houses, the multitude of ships, the inland canals and docks all denote wealth &amp; exertion, these last are of two kind wet and dry, the latter are to receive vessels to be repaired; the former are for ships to unload and load in; they are made by digging spaces to such a level as to be of sufficient depth for the vessels that are to enter the gates of these docks at which the vessels, and flow of the tide are received, are shut in the ebb tide by which means the water is retained that keeps the ships afloat – were it not for these constructions the lading and unlading would be performed with great inconvenience at this port which is not naturally well calculated, the River being amazing shallow at low water, and its entry rendered difficult from a number of sand banks.

        But the approximate situation of this place to several manufacturing town renders it the great emporium of commerce to the West – It is here that are deposited the stuffs of <placeName ref="manchester">Manchester</placeName>, the cutlery of <placeName ref="birmingham">Birmingham</placeName> and the woolen cloths of <placeName ref="yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>, as are also the produce of the west for which they are bartered – it is considered next to <placeName ref="london">London</placeName> for importance in trade: that of <placeName ref="africa">Africa</placeName> however is a branch that is carried on here to some extent and is not
        <del>meritorious</del><add>shore</add>
        to the human spe<lb/>cies; for it is a barter of their fellow creatures – you must not by this imagine, that the slaves are brought here, no, for none would be slaves after they had breathed the British air – they are bought in <placeName ref="africa">Africa</placeName> for coarse clothes, arms spirits &amp; taken to the <placeName ref="west-indies">West Indies</placeName> and sold for the produce of these Islands, which is brought to this place &amp; from it taken to different parts of the country.
