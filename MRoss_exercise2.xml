<source title="Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe.">
    This recipe comes from <collection>MS Codex 625</collection>, a manuscript recipe book 
    that belonged to a student in a <place>London</place> cooking school in the 
    <date when="early-18th-century">early eighteenth century</date>. 
    The pastry school was owned by Edward Kidder, who taught at a few locations 
    in <place>London</place> between around <date type="year">1720 and 1734</date>. Blank books with printed title pages 
    seem to have been used by students to write down recipes they learned.
    Kidder also published his recipes in the printed volume, 
    <title type="recipe">Receipts for Pastry and Cookery</title>, in 1720.

<steps>
    <step number="1">Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar.</step>
    <step number="2">Then add the eggs and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled.</step> 
    <step number="3">Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined.</step>
    <step number="4">Scoop and roll the dough by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat.</step>
    <step number="5" type="optional">You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s firm enough to roll out 
    on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.
    </step>
    <step number="6">
        Bake at <temp unit="F">350F</temp> for <time unit="minutes" min="15" max="18">15-18 minutes</time> (ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them thinner 
         and have a slightly shorter cooking time).

The Results

<results type="final">
    If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these. 
    We added the cinnamon because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out the mace nicely. 
    These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea. We rolled and patted 
    the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick to roll out, 
    but a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge might make the dough easier 
    to work with a rolling pin.
